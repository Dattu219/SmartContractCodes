  Multiplier contract: returns 123% of each investment!

  Automatic payouts!

  No bugs, no backdoors, NO OWNER - fully automatic!

  Made and checked by professionals!



  1. Send any sum to smart contract address

     - sum from 0.01 to 10 ETH

     - min 250000 gas limit

     - you are added to a queue

  2. Wait a little bit

  3. ...

  4. PROFIT! You have got 123%



  How is that?

  1. The first investor in the queue (you will become the

     first in some time) receives next investments until

     it become 123% of his initial investment.

  2. You will receive payments in several parts or all at once

  3. Once you receive 123% of your initial investment you are

     removed from the queue.

  4. You can make multiple deposits

  5. The balance of this contract should normally be 0 because

     all the money are immediately go to payouts





     So the last pays to the first (or to several first ones

     if the deposit big enough) and the investors paid 123% are removed from the queue
